The positive  gate voltage induces negative charges in N type channel through the insulating layer SiO2. Since, conduction of current through the N type channel is by means of majority carriers(i.e. electrons), the free electrons in the vicinity of positive charges are added together  in the N type channel. Thus, the positive gate voltage increases the number of free electrons passing through the N type channel. This increases the drain current flowing through the N type channel as a result, it enhances the conductivity of the N channel. Thus, it increases the drain current flowing through the N type  channel as the gate to source voltage become more positive.

      "In order to measure strain with a bonded resistance strain gauge, it must be connected to an electric circuit that is capable of measuring the minute changes in resistance corresponding to strain. Strain gauge transducers usually employ four strain gauge elements that are electrically connected to form a Wheatstone bridge circuit. The Figure shows a typical strain gauge diagram. A Wheatstone bridge is a divided bridge circuit used for the measurement of static or dynamic electrical resistance. The output voltage of the Wheatstone bridge is expressed in millivolts output per volt input. The Wheatstone circuit is also well suited for temperature compensation. The number of active strain gauges that should be connected to the bridge depends on the application. For example, it may be useful to connect gauges that are on opposite sides of a beam, one in compression and the other in tension. In this arrangement, one can effectively double the bridge output for the same strain. In installations where all of the arms are connected to strain gauges, temperature compensation is automatic as resistance change (due to temperature variations) will be the same for all arms of the bridge.  \n",
